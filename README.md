<b>BSides NoVA 2021 OSINT Mini-CTF Writeup</b>



This repo covers 2PAC's experiences in the mini-CTF for the OSINT workshop that took place during BSides NoVA 2021. As a whole, the CTF was an excellent introduction to practicing many of the skills required to conduct realworld OSINT research and reconnaissance. Most of the flags were attainable to newer practitioners, but at least two of them were very challenging.

Because Brian, the organizer of the workshop, may reuse this CTF at future conferences the specific flags have been **redacted** from the writeup. Care has been taken to cover the methodology used without giving the precise answer to any of the flags asked for during the CTF. Additionally, I am redacting Brian's last name from the writeup to reduce the possibility that someone accidentally stumbles upon the page while googling it in future CTFs.

# CTF Components
The CTF was broken into the following sections with specific section write-ups in the listed folders:

**1. Social Media**

**2. Google Dorking**

**3. Maps and GPS**

**4. EXIF**

**5. Technology**

# Results
2PAC ended up placing 2nd overall. The max score for the CTF was 385 and consisted of a flat score awarded for each flag regardless of previous participants getting the flag. The max score was achieved by 3 participants which fit nicely because the prizes were awarded for the Top 3 places in the CTF. 2nd Place prize was: [_Open Source Intelligence Techniques - Resources for Searching and Analyzing Information_ by Michaell Bazzell](https://inteltechniques.com/book1.html).
